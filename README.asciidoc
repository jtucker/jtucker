# Hey there, I'm Jason 👋

Currently, I work at https://microsoft.com[Microsoft] as a Sr. Software Engineer. I spend my days between helping build tools to aid in protecting customers and promoting trust in Microsoft's software through compliance/security and fighting cybercrime. Though mostly it's about sharing dank memes with co-workers. 

I've been working in this industry since 1998 and have had various roles including: 
- System Administration
- Developer (thick client & web)
- Consultant
- Scrum Master

I've been lucky enough to work on projects of all types:

- Simple web sites
- Airline passenger queueing predictive analytics
- Splitting monoliths into microservices

My current interests include:

- Functional programming, especially with F#
- Agile software methodologies
- Behaviour Driven Development
