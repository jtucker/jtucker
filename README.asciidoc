Currently, I work at https://microsoft.com[Microsoft] as a Sr. Consultant. I spend my days between helping customers work through digital transformations, developing solutions to aid their businesses and sharing dank memes with co-workers.

- System Administration
- Developer (thick client & web)

- Scrum Master

I've been lucky enough to work on projects of all types:

- Agile software methodologies
- Behaviour Driven Development
